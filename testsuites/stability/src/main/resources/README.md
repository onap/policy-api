Scripts and corresponding configurations under *apisetup* and *simulatorsetup* are not needed
if stability test is planned to run over ONAP OOM based Policy deployment in lab.

They are needed only if stability test is planned to run over component level deployment
(i.e. two VMs, one for API while the other for MariaDB).

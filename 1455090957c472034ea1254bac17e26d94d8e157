      "message": "Commenting the tests since PolicyProvider classes will become obsolete post migration to Hibernate.\nI tried to fixed the unit tests however, they seem to randomly fail and only on Linux OS. They all run fine on MAC OS. When running only a single unit test via \"mvn test\" cli even on Linux OS they pass, no issues. Seems like something to do with how spring context is cleared and/or ordering of autowired beans on different OS. Also, in general these classes should use mocks since starting the springboot container and clearing context esp. after each test method is expensive. We also have test coverage for the rest controller which is more of an integration test.\nPlease let me know your thoughts.",

      "message": "Or a random ordering problem - if I recall policy/engine had these issues because they were built on a developers machine that ran them in a specific order. Running on someone else\u0027s machine (usually my MAC!) would show random failures. Some best practice is to either require ordering, or have shutdown/start methods to assure a clean environment is there for each test.",
